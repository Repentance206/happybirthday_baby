Samriddhi,<br><br>
 I was travelling today, a journey tinged with stress and anxiety as someone in family battled in the confines of an ICU. When I was navigating the unfamiliar streets of Vaishali, a place alien to me. It was a grim situation filled with uncertainty as I pondered the unknown which awaited my arrival at Yashoda.
<br><br>
En route, through Ghaziabad Sec - 15 prolly, I came across a residential society board bearing the name <strong>'Samridhi Residential Society' </strong>. I remember the omission of an 'r' and after that frankly I don't care whether it was an RWA, society, colony, housing board or something else, the mere presence of your name was enough for a bit of calm for the soul,  for the belief it won't go wrong.
<br><br>
You can call it childish, outlandish, superstitious just like cat crossing a path, but when I went upto the ICU, I had that belief to hold me up. While returning, I had a smile on my lips, the signboard greeted me once more, bathed in the soft hues of dusk, dim lights echoing the subtle reminder. My faith has rewarded me, my good luck charm has worked like it always does, fueled by the belief that your ethereal presence is near, it won't abandon me in tough times. The person who has once hold me close had transitioned from the sterile confines of the ICU to a general ward, on her road to recovery within a day.
<br><br>
Now, as I pen down these words, they carry the weight of a steadfast belief that all will continue to unfold in the right way, as long as you are around, akin to a <strong>charm</strong> in my stormy mess of a life, a constant, my constant.
