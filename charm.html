	Hey buddy,
	 <br><br>
   I remember the next door chubby girl who hated being called little, or why everyone friend zones her, calls her sister. You are just so happy, the positive vibes, they expect you to be taken, so better score brownies with other girls and hence the conundrum. But, beyond all that there is a rustic charm about you, a sense of comfort, peace of home. For me, I crave to share every experience, big or small, for just being nearby keeps bad stuff away. 
	<br><br>
	If there is hope or happiness perching in my stars or planets, I believe you are somewhere in there, some manner, some role. Thank you for keeeping me grounded, showing the path back to life, also ending my love story before it started(i would love to insert an emoji here), so yea, you may be Hermione but no Ron and Viktor Krum for you, one percent they are not nice, rest I just don't like anyone around you, toxic male chauvinist behaviour. 
	<br><br>
	I don't want to be a passive observer when you are going through stuff, happy or sad, I don't like that frown. But jokes apart, god forbid if need arises, if I could ever repay even a drop for the ocean you have blessed me with, I will be there. I can't be and don't want to be a mere bystander to your laughter. It is more fun to create stuff with you or even after telling you, not for flex or praise just to share the joy. I don't want to walk and reach anywhere alone, I am too jaded for that, walk with me... what better way to be successful rather than keeping my lucky charm around? <br>
