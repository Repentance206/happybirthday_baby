	Cutieee,<br><br>
	The first time you came to talk to me on your own voilition, I was working on a report and it was throwing a error. You came with all four limbs poiniting in four different directions, arms akimbo, gave me a look and asked "What are you working on?" I told you, you solved it. I remember the error just fine but I also remember the frown you came out with, it was like, you have created problems, solve it, make me happy, say good stuff.	<br>
	And also, the day you got angry because I was trying to make your report work, and won't return your laptop and you called Harsh sir, you just weren't matching those parameters to their proper boxes. OOff, that frustated look and that attitude to me, all like, you know nothing, give my sytem back, I don't trust you, won't listen... those days, those memories... treasures for me!!
	<br><br>
	Those were the days I think I should have started thinking that you are lucky charm or solution to my problems, but that thought came quite late when you stopped talking. Around Diwali, and the first time after coming out from Udaipur, I recalled your worth in my life. I never want to go through those long days, monotonous schedule, be alone. So many friends, maybe it was your physical presence or just somehing else... That was the time, I noticed or really started to take notice, whatever I do, professionaly be it new project or recursive projects going on 4-5th of each month or something personal that I want to do for myself. It works smoothly only if you are there when it started or when it was ongoing. You are like the appsettings file in deployement, can't do without you.
	<br><br>
	I hate it when you fight but its very depressing when you get silent. I am always like how to make her smile, what I did wrong, I won't do it again, OK, now say something, it's like devastation for me all around. Every message burns that desire to check if you pinged, it's never you though and I know your habits, you won't message but still I check texts, every messaging app if you have sent me that angry emoji, so I can start somewhere. You never do but everytime, I expect you will text me the next morning even if we fight at night... I don't want my lucky charm to get lost in midnight blues. But, that's a story for another day. For now,
	<br><br>
	 I still don't like to see you frown and you have that face, cute as a button and lovely as a munchkin, it just doesn't look good without a smile. So, keep smiling..
