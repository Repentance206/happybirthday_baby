		<p> Lighthouse for my spirit,		 
<br><br> 
Time changes but it has a bad habit of taking away everything treasured. I don't want you to change, to lose you. Life is like the fury of the north sea, furious enough to tear apart the very soul, but with you around, I will sail through the storm with the promise of summer warmth. In my life, friendships and family have been like ships passing in the night; limited enough to be clutched by a set of hands each, maybe with a few digits to spare. So, I was trying to live like a flickering flame rather than a dragon's breath that can either give light and warmth, from the day I reached Udaipur.</italic>
<br><br>
Then from the day I landed in this city, time flew by. I started viewing you as a kid next door, then someway else, a changing equation, something to do with your opinions, some with my thought process, but over the year, I grew used to you and your company. I am used to watching you sweep your hair every day and eating bits and pieces like a squirrel. For you, time might be slow, but for me, time was very fast. When I left home, I never expected udaipur would offer me anything, or I would get so invested in this concrete forest. I hate this city, but I am happy if I have you in this city. From the day a girl has made me cry here till this day, when you have made me smile more, I don't know how to think or thank you. I am thankful for keeping me alive, not in a figure of speech or manner of speaking but literally, word for word. 
<br><br>
You won't know what you have done for me or maybe it was unintentional, but you have stopped someone one step closer from the abyss. The time you spent from mid-August to end of the October with me, you have kept someone hopelessly clinically depressed from doing stuff which would have been traumatic, maybe problematic. Each day, each step, each milestone to me is a challenge overcome, one more blessed day. To me, you are a teeny-tiny ember, capable of igniting a fire that illuminates my path for there is too much darkness ahead. 

<br> More than I need you, it would be better to say, I won't even be here if you haven't been tolerating me. If you are going through trouble, tell me, fight me if you must but stake your claim, don't start overthinking about what I will think. I will stop thinking, if it bothers you, you are not conversational stuff or gossip to me, you are sacred. 
<br><br>
Every day feels like a collection of fleeting moments, connections made and lost in the blink of an eye. Friendships drift away, family ties loosen, leaving a hollowness that echoes in the soul over time. You are troubled too, but you bottle it up, most of the time. You won't tell me, or I have to prod you super hard to get a nugget or two. I just want to see you trouble-free, silent is okay, but happy is good. My shoulder is and will always be a safe haven for your hefty burdens, and you can have fun in  your happy moments with your best buddies. For me, I am happy to see you smile from afar. 
 <br><br>
 I don't know where next after this city. You might not even miss me after a day or two, but still I think “Will there will be a chance to see you again? Must we part?” You were the missing piece, the reason my life has taken flight over the past year, not just possible, but real. Life breaks everyone, but afterwards some become strong at the broken places. Thank you, for being a blessing, thank you for sitting in those rainy days while suffering from cramps with me, sitting through those mosquitoes and me. Thank you for that human touch, a little bit of emotions to calm my volatile personality. 
 <br>I won't deny you your day, I have written enough stupid stuff but whatever is mine, you can have it. Anything for your smile, just say it, all i request is _ keep that frown away, have a smile on your lips, you have nice lips btw.. I will be so lost without you and I don't have the energy to heal again.  Now, I only care if you are happy, not the hows and whys or the logic behind. Anything for you, if it makes you happy then its good enough but never share my time for you with anyone else. Share your sorrows, share your pains, don't hide, don't feel the need to bottle it up. But beyond that just stay. I am too tired to break aprt everything and too old to rebuild stuff. Also, though I'm rarely happy but don't abandon me in my joy, stay as my pride, have my secrets secured deep in your soul... I trust you.
 <br><br>
 One day, I met you and now I don't want to let go. I still speak slowly but after a time, when my voice gets extremely weak, I hope you would bother and  could still listen. If there’s really a next life_ I still want to see you… accompany you on your journey… enjoy the years together… see you, smile just coz you are there and be quiet… but be there as a small minuscule part of your life...  I suddenly realize that I am a nostalgic person. In the past, I have always felt that the people around me were just passers-by of life. However, some people who I have accompanied for a long time, I realize I would be reluctant to part with them.. you most of all. When the sun sets in my life, when I will like to have a closest ones around me, when my hands grow weak 
			and when I embark on my last journey, when voice fails, let me lean against your shoulders till my breath gets its final release as if I had fallen asleep peacefully. 
 <br>
 If there is a fidelius charm for a muggle like myself: "Please be my secret keeper"!!<br><br>
